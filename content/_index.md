## Definition of the term 'Formal Method'

It can be difficult to precisely define what is a formal method. A popular formulation is that it is a technique for developing correct software which is based on mathematical rigorius principles. The Wikipedia offers a more elaborate [definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods).

The benefit of using formal methods is intended to be more __reliable__ software and hardware systems. Also __productivity gains__ can be expected with some methods. Some formal methods provide a structured rigorous way to think about a problem up front, which in itself has advantages (even in lack of tool support). Other formal methods are code oriented, and can ensure that written code is correct.
