1. Encourage use of formal methods in industry. This includes increasing the awareness in industry of formal methods, e.g. informing about which formal methods are available, which companies use formal methods, which companies offer formal methods and consultancy, industrial success stories of formal methods, and other relevant material such as links to papers concerned with the above aspects. It also includes announcement of industrially oriented events.

2. Increase the awareness in the formal methods community of industrial use of formal methods. This forms a feedback on what works and what does not work in practice, and can help steer the formal methods community towards successful approaches.

3. Facilitate collaboration between the formal methods community and industry.

### Definition of Formal Methods

It can be difficult to precisely define what is a formal method. A popular formulation is that it is a technique for developing correct software which is based on mathematical rigorius principles. The Wikipedia offers a more elaborate [definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods).

The benefit of using formal methods is intended to be more __reliable__ software and hardware systems. Also __productivity gains__ can be expected with some methods. Some formal methods provide a structured rigorous way to think about a problem up front, which in itself has advantages (even in lack of tool support). Other formal methods are code oriented, and can ensure that written code is correct.
